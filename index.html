                            Science in Accountancy but quickly moved on to tech. I have taught myself the fundamentals of HTML, CSS,
                            and JavaScript before starting to attend Discovery Partners Institute. At DPI, I have been trainng to become 
                            a software developer apprentice and thus learned databse design, authentication, domain modeling, and Ruby on Rails. 
                            Towards the end, I am very grateful that SAP decided to give me a chance to intern as a data scientist to help me 
                            grow professionally. Over time, I have gained new valuable skills such as advanced functions in Excel, Power Query, 
                            Power BI, and SAP Analytics Cloud. Also during my spare time, I also completed my own data project, which is about COVID-19

                        It was so fantastic that no words can describe! Two of my favorite places that I have visited would
                        be snowy white mountains in Switzerland and unparalled musical experience in Vienna. At some point in my life, 
                        I would love to revisit! So far, I have travelled over 20 countries including UK, France, Spain, Switzerland, 
                        Greece, Italy, Egypt, Turkey, and so on. 
                        
                        During last winter, I have also visited Thailand and Peru. In Thailand, I went to see various island in Phang Nga Bay including 
                        the one that James Bond had starred in from the movie Goldfinger. I've also met elephants in sanctuaries and monkeys by the beaches. 
                        The weather was very warm as well! After Thailand, I flew to Peru right away. I've got a chance to see Machu Picchu despite with all the protests going on at that time!
                        I've climbed the Andes Mountains and walked the Incan trail 2,500 meters above the sea level. 
                        
                        
                        And I'm not even done yet. There will be more to come.

                        to miss this! Relaxing in this heated mily water felt very rejuvenating when I went there right after
                        I graduated! The start contrast of cold air and semi-hot mineral-filled water felt amazing beyond words.

                        are colored lights that appear in the polar regions during night. Think of it as a natural fireworks 
                        when solar wind blows electrons into Earth's atmosphere and mix gases. Mixing gases is what makes 
                        particles glow. You will have the best chance of seeing it during the winter months.

                        Sorry ladies, the crystal-like structures that are laying by the shores are not actually giant 
                        diamonds. Nor is this beach one of the beaches that you would want to go swimming in. What you are 
                        seeing are chunks of icebergs that broke off from Jökulsárlón Glaciers that floated ashore. The black
                        sands have originated from volcanic materials that have grinded into fine particles over time.

                        thinner than at the ground level. But guess what? At 4,158 meters, that's only about 40% of getting to top of Mount Everest! It's not even halfway. 
                        Can you imagine what kind of endurance it will take to become a great mountainer climber?

                        <p class="text-secondary">As you may have seen before, the Giza Pyramids are located in the western city of the Nile River called the 
                        Giza. The pyramids have been built around 2500 BC. The workers have toiled all day to build them as a tomb for generations for pharoahs.
                        Unlike the popular myth, the workers were not slaves. They were normal citizens working for the government just like how we have USPS 
                        workers. Imagine how hot it was for them to be working outside all day! The first day I arrived in Egypt, the temperature reached staggering
                        40 degrees Celsius! But the view of the pyramids has been definitely worth it! This is one of the last surviving Seven Wonders of the World today.

                        <p class="text-secondary">I don't know if you have watched the movie The Gladiator but it was based on the ancient stadium, located in Rome.
                        It was built around 70 AD during the height of the Roman Empire. Emperors and other Roman citizens enjoyed gladiators fighting, dramas, and public
                        executions. The Colosseum seated more than 50,000 so multiple entrances have been constructed as well. It may now sit in ruins but millions of tourists
                        go there every year. When you visit Italy, Colosseum is not something you would want to miss.

                        <p class="text-secondary">Traveling to Venice would not be complete unless you ride in one of the gondolas and listen to Carnival of Venice or other
                        romantic violin pieces. It would be like going to Paris but not seeing Eiffel Tower. Venice has been used as a port town for trading during the Medieval 
                        Period. Another interesting fact about it is that it is sinking between one to two millimeter per year. Rumors has it that Venice could be partially submerged
                        by 2030. There is one crazy rule that I have learned while I travelled there. You are not allowed to sit down in public unless you're in a cafef or 
                        restaurant. If you get caught, then you either have to pay the fine on the spot or spend a night in jail.

                        <h4 class="my-4 fw-bold">Danube River</h4>
                        <p class="text-secondary">Located in capital of Austria, Vienna, this particular river has been an inspiration to this world-renowned composer Johann 
                        Strauss. Even if you have never heard of his name, I still think you may have heard of his most famous waltz, The Blue Danube Waltz. I heard that he may
                        have taken a canoe ride along the river one time and got inspired. When I arrived in Vienna, I do admit that the river was gorgeous. I am a big lover of 
                        music. I came to Vienna alone to feel the essence of composers such as Mozart, Beethoven, and Strauss. Not only did I go sightseeing, the best part for me 
                        in Vienna was that during my last night, I attended the small concert in Kursalon. The orchestra was much smaller than in traditional symphony centers. There 
                        was not even a conductor waving his wand! The musicians were very well-synchronized. Out of everything I've seen, I enjoyed the dancing couple the most. The 
                        ballerina looked so gorgeous! She twirled and kicked high gracefully! Back to the river, I definitely want to visit Vienna again in the future.

                <div class="row d-flex justify-content-center mb-4">
                    
                    <div class="col-md-8">
    
                        <p>Since the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020, I started to realize that I've 
                        wanted to make the most out of what I can in this given situation. Lots of employers had
                        laid off, not knowing what to do initially. Seeing these past two years as a grand opportunity,
                        I decided to learn a new skill that will not only set me up for the rest of my working life but
                        to enjoy working remotely as well. Working onsite may have its own advantages but I definitely 
                        prefer working remotely full time. I would be fine working onsite to learn various transferrable 
                        skills for certain number of years. Then there will come a moment when I have finished learning
                        the ropes and would want to work wherever I desire.
                        </p>

                        <p>My friend has also graduated with integrated biology with technology but wanted to travel
                        all over the world. He inspired me to become a digital nomad. Digital nomads are people who
                        are not tied to one specific location. I want to be free from this restriction at some point in my
                        career. Working in accounting/finance may be a respectable career but that's not the path I want to 
                        be married to. Who am I? I AM A FREE SPIRIT!
                        </p>

                        <p>During the September of 2022, I began attending Discovery Partners Institute to become a software 
                        developer. My instructor Raghu Betina taught me Ruby on Rails so that I will be ready to showcase my
                        Photogram (mock-up version of Instagram) towards the graduation in December 2022. Meanwhile learning 
                        data modeling along the way, my guardian angel employer showed up! SAP, thank you so much for giving 
                        me this wonderful opportunity. I must thank the SAP leaders such as Kristina Gsedl, Jessica Wescott, 
                        Lou Meshulam, and Mark Kenney for openging the door.
                        </p>

                        <p>Moving fast forward to January 2023, I began interning as a data scientist. My mentor Brian Nguyen
                        had taught me a lot of valuable skills such as Power Query, v-lookups, Power BI, and SAC Analytic Cloud. 
                        I felt I had learned a lot over the past 7 months and feel ready to take on more responsibilities as a 
                        future full time. In order to get there, I had to prove that I sometimes to take initiatves beyond just the 
                        job description. During my spare time, I had partaken in my own data project that had nothing to do with SAP. 
                        It was about COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations over time. To complete this project, I had to learn a lot about 
                        SQL and Tableau on my own time. Even with the given Excel file, I had to figure out which columns were deemed
                        necessary and which ones I needed to cut out. I won't go over too much details here but I will say it took me 
                        longer than I anticipated but I am glad that I powered through. As a result, I managed to get the results that 
                        I've wanted in my Tableau dashboard, and the url link will be included in my resume. 

                        I am very excited to be on this learning journey and want to see how far I will get in my career. Great rewards 
                        comes to those who are willing to put in the effort all the way.
